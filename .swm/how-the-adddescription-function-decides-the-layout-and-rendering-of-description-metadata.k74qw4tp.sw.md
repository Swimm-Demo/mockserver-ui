This document will cover how the `addDescription` function decides the layout and rendering of description metadata. We'll cover:

1. The purpose of the `addDescription` function
2. How the layout is determined
3. How the rendering is handled

# The purpose of the `addDescription` function

The `addDescription` function is responsible for adding metadata descriptions to the UI components. This function ensures that the metadata is correctly formatted and displayed within the user interface.

# How the layout is determined

The layout of the description metadata is determined by the structure defined within the `addDescription` function. This function takes into account various parameters such as the type of metadata and its content to decide the appropriate layout. For example, if the metadata is of type 'text', it will be rendered in a simple text layout, whereas if it is of type 'image', it will be rendered with an image layout.

# How the rendering is handled

The rendering of the description metadata is handled by the `renderDescription` method within the `addDescription` function. This method ensures that the metadata is displayed correctly on the UI by applying the necessary styles and formatting. It also handles any dynamic content that needs to be rendered based on the metadata type.
