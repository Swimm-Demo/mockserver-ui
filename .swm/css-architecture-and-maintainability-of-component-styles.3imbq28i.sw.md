title: CSS Architecture and Maintainability of Component Styles
---
This document will cover how the CSS architecture contributes to the maintainability of the components' styles. We'll cover:

1. The structure of CSS files
2. The use of specific CSS rules and their impact
3. Examples from the codebase

# The structure of CSS files

The CSS architecture in the project is organized by component, with each component having its own CSS file. This modular approach ensures that styles are scoped to individual components, reducing the risk of style conflicts and making it easier to maintain and update styles.

# The structure of CSS files

The `form.css` file contains styles specific to form elements, such as the `.material-icons` class. This class ensures that the Material Icons font is correctly applied and displayed across different browsers.

```css
.material-icons {
    font-family: 'Material Icons';
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
    font-size: 24px;  /* Preferred icon size */
    display: inline-block;
    line-height: 1;
    text-transform: none;
    letter-spacing: normal;
    word-wrap: normal;
    white-space: nowrap;
    direction: ltr;

    /* Support for all WebKit browsers. */
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    /* Support for Safari and Chrome. */
    text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;

    /* Support for Firefox. */
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;

```

<SwmSnippet path="/src/components/log.css" line="1">

---

The `log.css` file contains styles specific to log elements, such as custom styles for `details` and `summary` elements. This file ensures that log elements are consistently styled and easy to maintain.

```css
summary::-webkit-details-marker {
    color: rgb(178, 148, 187);
    height: 10px;
    width: 8px;
}

*:focus {
    outline: 0;
}

details.logGroup summary::-webkit-details-marker {
    display: none;
}

details.logGroup > summary:first-of-type {
    list-style-type: none;
}

details.logGroup[open] .logGroupSummaryClosed {
    display: none;
}
```

<SwmSnippet path="/src/containers/grid.css" line="1">

---

The `grid.css` file contains styles for grid layouts, including custom font-face declarations. This file ensures that grid layouts are consistently styled and easy to maintain.

```css
.row:after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}

@font-face {
    font-family: 'Averia Sans Libre';
    font-style: normal;
    font-weight: 400;
    src: url('/mockserver/dashboard/AveriaSansLibre-Regular.ttf');
    src: url('/mockserver/dashboard/AveriaSansLibre-Regular.woff2') format('woff2'), url('/mockserver/dashboard/AveriaSansLibre-Regular.ttf')  format('truetype');
    unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
}
```

# The use of specific CSS rules and their impact

The CSS files use specific rules to ensure cross-browser compatibility and consistent styling. For example, the `.material-icons` class in `form.css` includes rules for font smoothing and text rendering across different browsers. Similarly, the `log.css` file includes custom styles for `details` and `summary` elements to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

# Examples from the codebase

Here are some examples of how the CSS architecture is implemented in the codebase:

- The `form.css` file includes styles for Material Icons, ensuring consistent icon appearance across different browsers.
- The `log.css` file includes custom styles for log elements, ensuring consistent behavior and appearance.
- The `grid.css` file includes styles for grid layouts, ensuring consistent layout and appearance.
