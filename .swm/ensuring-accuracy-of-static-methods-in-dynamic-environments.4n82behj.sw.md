title: Ensuring Accuracy of Static Methods in Dynamic Environments
---
This document will cover how the application ensures that static methods provide correct values. We'll cover:

1. Defining static methods
2. Validating static methods
3. Testing static methods

# Defining static methods

Static methods are defined within a class and are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class. They are typically used for utility functions that are related to the class but do not require access to instance-specific data.

# Validating static methods

To ensure that static methods provide correct values, it is crucial to validate their inputs and outputs. This can be done through various means such as type checking, input validation, and ensuring that the methods adhere to the expected logic and business rules.

# Testing static methods

Testing is a critical part of ensuring that static methods provide correct values. Unit tests should be written to cover various scenarios, including edge cases, to verify that the static methods behave as expected. Mocking and stubbing can be used to isolate the methods and test them in a controlled environment.

# Testing static methods

In this example, the static method `calculateSum` is defined to add two numbers. Unit tests should be written to ensure it handles various cases correctly, such as positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.

Here, unit tests for the `calculateSum` method are defined. These tests check if the method returns the correct sum for different inputs, ensuring the method's correctness.
