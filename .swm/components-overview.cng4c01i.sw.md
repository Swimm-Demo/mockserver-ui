title: Components Overview
---
Components are the building blocks of the user interface, encapsulating the structure, behavior, and appearance of UI elements.

Each component is typically a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs, known as props, and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.

For example, the <SwmToken path="src/components/JsonItem.js" pos="6:6:6" line-data="export default class JsonItem extends Component {">`JsonItem`</SwmToken> component is used to render JSON data in a structured and readable format, with optional descriptions and clipboard functionality.

Components can be composed together to build complex UIs. For instance, <SwmToken path="src/components/JsonItem.js" pos="6:6:6" line-data="export default class JsonItem extends Component {">`JsonItem`</SwmToken> is used within other components like `LogMessage` and `JsonList` to display JSON data in different contexts.

Styling for components is managed through CSS files, such as <SwmPath>[src/components/jsonItem.css](src/components/jsonItem.css)</SwmPath>, <SwmPath>[src/components/form.css](src/components/form.css)</SwmPath>, and <SwmPath>[src/components/log.css](src/components/log.css)</SwmPath>, which define the visual appearance of the components.

Components are also tested to ensure they behave as expected. For instance, <SwmPath>[src/components/JsonItem.spec.js](src/components/JsonItem.spec.js)</SwmPath> contains tests for the <SwmToken path="src/components/JsonItem.js" pos="6:6:6" line-data="export default class JsonItem extends Component {">`JsonItem`</SwmToken> component to verify its rendering and functionality.

## Example of a Component

The <SwmToken path="src/components/JsonItem.js" pos="6:6:6" line-data="export default class JsonItem extends Component {">`JsonItem`</SwmToken> component is used to render JSON data in a structured and readable format, with optional descriptions and clipboard functionality.

```javascript
export default class JsonItem extends Component {
    static propTypes = {
        description: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.object.isRequired, PropTypes.string.isRequired]),
        jsonItem: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string.isRequired, PropTypes.object.isRequired, PropTypes.array.isRequired]).isRequired,
    };
```

## Composing Components

Components can be composed together to build complex UIs. For instance, <SwmToken path="src/components/JsonItem.js" pos="6:6:6" line-data="export default class JsonItem extends Component {">`JsonItem`</SwmToken> is used within other components like `LogMessage` and `JsonList` to display JSON data in different contexts.

## Styling Components

Styling for components is managed through CSS files, such as <SwmPath>[src/components/jsonItem.css](src/components/jsonItem.css)</SwmPath>, <SwmPath>[src/components/form.css](src/components/form.css)</SwmPath>, and <SwmPath>[src/components/log.css](src/components/log.css)</SwmPath>, which define the visual appearance of the components.

## Testing Components

Components are also tested to ensure they behave as expected. For instance, <SwmPath>[src/components/JsonItem.spec.js](src/components/JsonItem.spec.js)</SwmPath> contains tests for the <SwmToken path="src/components/JsonItem.js" pos="6:6:6" line-data="export default class JsonItem extends Component {">`JsonItem`</SwmToken> component to verify its rendering and functionality.
